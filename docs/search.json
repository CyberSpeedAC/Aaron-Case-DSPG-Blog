    "text": "Web scraping in essence is the process of extracting data from websites using automated software. As for the process, the web-scraping pipeline goes as follows.\n\nSetup - Understand what we want to do and find sources to help us do it.\nAcquisition\n\nRead in the raw data from online.\nFormat these data to be usable.\nAccessing the data.\nParsing this information.\nExtracting these data into meaningful and useful data structures.\n\nProcessing - There are many options to this but the main goal is to run the downloaded data through whatever analyses or processes needed to achieve the desired goal.\n\nThere are many web scraping tools available, but two of the one’s that I’ve the most success in are Scrapy and Selenium.\nScrapy is a Python package that is primarily used for web scraping. Scrapy provides a framework that offers a simple web crawling tool to extract data from websites. These tools are commonly known as spiders and allow for easy extraction of desired information. A spider program can crawl through websites and extracts data from them (Just like real spiders crawl through there webs). Scrapy works by sending HTTP requests to websites and receiving HTML responses, then the spider parses the HTML to extract the data it needs. There is a Data camp course that is currently available to use and is highly recommended watching. These are some of benefit of using Scrapy that I’ve found:\n\nScrapy is designed to be fast and can handle large volumes of data. It’s built on top of Twisted, an asynchronous networking framework, which in simple terms makes it very fast. It can handle thousands of requests per second without slowing down. This makes it really handy for the scope of this project.\nScrapy is highly customizable and can be configured to work with many different websites and data formats. Allowing us to specify how the spider should act when navigating through websites and extract data that we told it to collect. Scrapy also provides features for handling cookies, redirects, and other HTTP features.\nScrapy comes with built-in support for XPath and CSS selectors. With the right skill set these tools provide a powerful and easy way to extract data from HTML and XML documents.\nScrapy automatically comes with built-in support for data cleaning, Making the the cleaning and normalize scraped data much easier.\n\nAs for the cons of Scrapy:\n\nScrapy does have a relatively steep learning curve to it. Especially if you are new to web scraping, XPath/CSS selectors, or asynchronous programming. Unless you have more than a week to spend learning and doing web scrapping it is best to spend the time doing another method. Not to mention the fact that you need to have some knowledge of Python to use it effectively\nScrapy does not have built-in support for JavaScript, which means that it cannot scrape websites and other dynamic web content that rely heavily on JavaScript for rendering content. Which a vast amount of websites rely on to function.\nThis tool is not perfect nor undetectable. Some websites may block Scrapy from accessing their content, especially if they detect that the traffic is coming from a bot.\nScrapy does help you in cleaning data however it is not perfect. You still need to spend some time cleaning the data that was collected and may require additional libraries, such as Pandas or NumPy, to process and analyze scraped data.\n\nSelenium is another Python package which is used for automating web browsers. It allows you to control a browser programatically, which mimics the actions of a what a user will do. Selenium uses a web driver to control your web browser and can interact with several different browsers (such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari). Selenium works by opening up a web browser and navigates to the target website. The user can then interact with the website using Selenium commands. Just like Scrapy, Selenium can also extract data from the website using XPath and CSS selectors. As for some of benefit of using Selenium:\n\nSelenium has the ability to handle JavaScript and other dynamic web content. Allowing it to handle websites that Scrapy is unable too.\nSelenium can handle more complex interactions with websites, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, scrolling, etc. which can simulate user behavior. Making Selenium more diverse and a power tool to use when doing specific tasks that require a more human like approach.\n\nFor the Cons of Selenium:\n\nSelenium can be really slow and very resource-intensive. Especially when automating complex tasks or interacting with multiple pages. It requires your web browser to be opened to run meaning If your internet or computer is slow it has a really hard time doing anything you want it. This time that you have to wait for the program to preform any simple task is not ideal when working through large data sets.\nIt is prone to errors and requires extensive debugging and testing. For example, if say that you close your browser or if it freezes (for long periods of time) the program will not function correctly and throw an error.\nIt can be very challenging to set up and configure. Not to mention that It can be difficult to maintain test scripts when the web application is updated or changed. Meaning if you are not dedicated in learning or maintaining your code it will come with a bunch of headaches down the road.\n\nIdeally for this project I strongly recommend using Scrapy spiders were ever possible. Scrapy’s speed and efficiency and overall better performance makes this part of the process much more tolerable in building spiders. However, when it comes to more complex tasks and websites Selenium is the way to go. I would also like to acknowledge that there are other tools and resources that could have been explored and used which may be better or more efficient for the scope of the project. These two tools are just some that I found and was able to implement in the time frame I was given. For example, there is a python package called Scrapy Splash. This works as an extension for Scrapy which provides a JavaScript rendering service. Allowing Scrapy to handle JavaScript and other dynamic web content, similar to Selenium. I was not able to master this tool, nor could I successfully get it this tool to work. If I had more time to develop a clear comprehension of this utility and fully understood how to get it to work. It would have been the tool of choice to handle such websites. I used Selenium since I had more success in getting it to work in comparison.\nThis code covers the bare minimum of Scrapy and is rather (hopefully) intuitive. This can be edited/modified to fit your needs and is just an example.\n\n# Imports for Scrapy Example\nimport scrapy #Required Import\nfrom scrapy.crawler import CrawlerProcess\nfrom scrapy.utils.log import configure_logging # For debugging\n\n# The Class name can be anything but you need to call this later\nclass SpiderClassName(scrapy.Spider):\n    name = \"spider name\" \n\n    def start_requests( self ): # This is required to start the spider\n        # For one url\n        Desired_Website = [ 'https://www.example.com' ]\n        yield scrapy.Request( url = Desired_Website, callback = self.Some_Function_Name)\n\n        # For many urls\n        urls = [ 'https://www.examples.com', ... ]\n        for url in urls:\n            yield scrapy.Request( url = url, callback = self.parseAndFollow)\n\n        # When passing in varables from one function to the next you use meta\n        for url in urls:\n            yield scrapy.Request( url = url, callback = self.Meta_Example, meta={'Meta_Name': data, ...})\n    \n    def parseAndFollow( self, response ):\n        # Direct to the links in the xpath\n        Extrated_XPath = '//tag-name(@attribute, \"attrib info\")'\n        XPath_links = Extrated_XPath.xpath( './@href' )\n        # Anoter way\n        XPath_links = Extrated_XPath.xpath('//tag-name(@attribute, \"attrib info\")/@href')\n        # Extract the links (as a list of strings)\n        links_to_follow = XPath_links.extract()\n        # Follow the links to the next parser\n        for url in links_to_follow:\n            yield response.follow( url = url, callback = self.parse )\n    \n    def parse( self, response ):\n        # To get the text of the xpath\n        Title_Example = response.xpath('//h1[contains(@class,\"title\")]/text()') \n        # Extract text title\n        Title_Extracted = Title_Example.extract_first()\n        # Clean the title text\n        Title_Text = Title_Extracted.strip()\n        # Saving the text so that we dont lose what we just did\n        Text_Element_List.append(Title_Text)\n\n    def Meta_Example( self, response ):\n        #This is how pass in your arguments\n        Meta_Data = response.meta.get('Meta_Name')\n    \nText_Element_List = []\n# To see the inner mechanics of the spider helpful to have not required\nconfigure_logging()\n# initiate a CrawlerProcess\nprocess = CrawlerProcess()\n# Tell the process which spider to use\nprocess.crawl(SpiderClassName)\n# Start the crawling process\nprocess.start()\n# This is to stop the spider\nprocess.stop()\n# At this point the spider is finished and now we have everything that was saved\nprint(Text_Element_List)\n\nAs for Selenium this code covers the bare minimum and serves as a deminstration of how to handle JavaScript websites. Once again this can be edited/modified to fit your needs and is just an example.\n\n# Imports for Scraping\nimport selenium\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\n\n# Since I use Firefox this is how I would typically set it up.\n# Note: This is not the only way to do it.

This week was dedicated to gathering relevant information and conducting thorough research to support our project goals. In Week Three Research, I have compiled and summarized the information I gathered while researching bacon, eggs, and heirloom tomatoes. This resource outlines and highlights the key findings that I was able to uncover during my investigation.\nIn addition to our focus on research and data collection, I also prioritized learning during week three. Using Data camps and successfully completed Writing Efficient R Code lecture. Recognizing the crucial role of data collection in our project, I took the initiative in learning how to create web scrapers, also known as spiders. This involved dedicating a large portion of the week as well as most of my free time to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge in this area. My efforts in this yielded some positive results. I was able to successfully created a spider that efficiently extracts data from the provided weblink and organizes it into a pandas dataframe. The reason we store the data in this dataframe is because it makes it much easier to work with, especially when it comes to cleaning and exporting it into a comma-separated values (CSV) file for future use. It is important to note that while this image showcases an output of the extraction process, it is crucial to understand that it is far from being considered a finished product.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nFinally at the end of the week I was tasked to present our weekly wrap up for the Team.

Additionally, During week four I participated in the collection of housing data in Slater Iowa for the WINVEST project. While this activity was aimed for preparation for whats to come in Week Six it did not detract from the primary focus on learning and building spiders during week four.\nFor a detailed explanation of my endeavors and what I have learned, you can visit this link: Spiders.

    "text": "During week five, although it may not hold the utmost significance for the scope of the project, I wanted to mention that I had the opportunity to attend the ITAG VI conference. Throughout the conference, I had the privilege of attending various insightful lectures. While this detail may not directly impact the project, it is worth documenting as it contributes to my overall knowledge and professional growth. This conference provided valuable opportunities to learn from experts in their respective fields and gain new perspectives.\nAs for the majority of the week, my primary focus was on building and optimizing spiders. By the end of the week, I successfully completed the construction of four additional spiders, bringing the total number of spiders built for the project to seven. While progress has been made, there are still several improvements that need to be addressed before considering any of the spiders as finished.\nDue to performance issues and consistent absenteeism within our team, we had to make some changes that resulted in substantial delays to the current progression of our project. As a result, I was assigned the task of cleaning the data alongside spider development.\nIn light of these challenges, I believed it would be best to turn this hindrance into an opportunity by implementing a data cleaning program that runs concurrently within the spider! The purpose of this concurrent operation is to ensure the accuracy of the collected data. By incorporating this data cleaning program within each spider using composition, we can easily monitor the collection and cleaning processes in real time without compromising speed and efficiency.\nThis approach allows us to efficiently address data quality issues, ensuring that the collected data is reliable and ready for analysis. The main objective of this program is to guarantee that the collected data is thoroughly cleaned before integrating it into the pandas dataframe. This ensures that the data is ready to be exported in the CSV file format, providing a seamless transition for further analysis and utilization.\nNot only would this approach solve our current situation, but it would also make our programs more dynamic and easily adaptable. This means that we can easily incorporate more products to be added and cleaned for future development, ensuring that our system remains flexible and scalable!\nExpanding upon what I’ve learned in week four, I would like to direct you to the following link which provides a more in-depth summary of my knowledge of Spiders. This summary not only delves into the concepts and techniques I have learned, but also includes some example code to further illustrate them. Feel free to explore the link and delve deeper into my progress.\nAs for those who have been following our project and reading my previous posts, I would like to provide a recap of the spiders that have been developed so far:\n1. Fresh Thyme\n2. Hy-Vee\n3. Gateway Market\n4. New Pioneer Co-op\n5. Russ’s Market\n6. Iowa Food Hub\n7. Joia Food Farm"

    "text": "On Monday of week six, as briefly mentioned in Week Four, DSPG conducted assessments of houses in Grundy Center and New Hampton by taking pictures and tracking their characteristics using the Fulcrum app. We then continued our evaluations in Independence on Tuesday, which marked the conclusion of our WINVEST site assessments.\nDuring the assessments, we meticulously examined the houses’ structural features and recorded detailed notes on the condition of the driveway, foundation, gutters, paint, porch, roof, siding, walls, and window frames, as well as any other noteworthy features that were in poor condition. We also took into account the condition of the lot, noting any junk or debris present on the site. Additionally, we evaluated the sidewalk connecting to the house and made note of its condition. We paid extra close attention to the gutters, roof, siding, and landscape, assessing whether they were in good, fair, or poor condition. As we took and evaluated the pictures, we meticulously noted any obstructions in the photo(s) taken, paying close attention to whether they were caused by overgrown vegetation (such as bushes or weeds), trees, electrical posts, cars, or any other obstructions.\nAlong with evaluation of the housing, we also took note of our general impressions of the block. We evaluated the neighborhood sidewalks, taking note of whether they were partial or only on one side, and if they had curb cuts for easy accessibility at intersections. Additionally, we assessed the condition of the sidewalks, ranking them to determine if they were unsafe and in need of repair or replacement. We also assessed the condition of the street trees and evaluated their overall health, marking any that appeared to be in poor condition. We took note of the presence and condition of street lights, paying special attention to the brightness and coverage of the lights. We also marked the location of any street signs for wayfinding. Additionally, we identified the type of storm drain, whether it was a ditch/swale, curb/gutter, or another type of system. Finally to document our observations, we took pictures of both sides of the street block, capturing any notable features or areas of concern. Additionally, if we identified any flaws or damages in the sidewalk, we took pictures to document the issues.\nHere are the comprehensive maps of our WINVEST site assessments, as well as a photo of a typical house that we would assess.\n \n\n\n\nHouse in Independence Location 1\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependence Location 1\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependence Location 2\n\n\nOn Wednesday, our team had a much-needed meeting with our client. In light of the team changes that occurred last week, we found it necessary to reevaluate the scope of the project. This allowed us to ensure that we are aligned with the client’s expectations and make any necessary adjustments to our plans moving forward. By the end of the meeting, I was assigned to improve all seven spider and finish implementing the data cleaner program that was described in Week Five. Additionally, I was tasked with demonstrating that other products could be implemented into the spiders, all by next Wednesday. This means that I have a deadline to complete these tasks and showcase the flexibility of my system in incorporating new products. Which took up the majority of my time to finish.\nOn Thursday, I delivered a coffee talk on spiders, providing a concise summary of everything I have learned, which you can view here:"

    "text": "Demand and supply estimation\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Supply and demand estimation requires further correction, and the methodology needs improvements.\n\n\nDemand Estimation:\n\nThe population of United States is 334.9 million as of June 26, 2023. (https://www.census.gov/popclock/)\nIn 2017, fresh market consumption was 20.3 pounds per capita. (https://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/vegetables/tomatoes)\nSo, the demand for fresh tomatoes in the United States is (334.9 million x 20.3 pounds) or 3.08 Million Metric Tons.\nThere is around 1% of the US population lives in Iowa.\nThat translates to 30.8 thousand Metric Tons of tomatoes demand in Iowa.\nConsidering the demand for tomatoes stays the same for 52 weeks. The demand for tomatoes in Iowa per week is 592 Metric Tons.\nWe will allocate this demand to each county of Iowa by population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupply Estimation:\n\nThe growing season of tomatoes is between May to Mid-September in Iowa. (https://www.tomatofest.com/Tomato_Growing_Zone_Maps_s/164.htm)\nWe have 135 days between planting and harvesting tomatoes.\nTomatoes require 100 days to fully mature. However, there are some special varieties of tomatoes that require 50-60 days to mature.  (https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/tomato/planting-time-for-tomatoes.htm)\nSo, we are considering on average tomatoes take 80 days to be harvested.\nIn this context, we assumed that being mature represents the time between sowing seed and harvesting full-grown tomatoes.\nWe are only considering single cultivation of tomatoes during a year.\nSo, the tomatoes will be harvested during the timeline day 80-135 or, during late July to mid-September, that is 7.85 or 8 weeks. \nIn our calculations, we will estimate the weekly supply of tomatoes from late July to mid-September.\nIn 2020, approximately 12,619.2 tons of fresh market tomatoes were harvested from approximately 272,900 acres. (https://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/vegetables/tomatoes)\nFlorida and California account for about two-thirds of the national fresh tomato production (Wu, F., Guan, Z., & Suh, D. H. (2017). The Effects of Tomato Suspension Agreements on Market Price Dynamics.; mentioned in https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/FE1027)\nThe remaining 48 states are responsible for one-third of the national fresh tomatoes. That is 4206.4 tons.\nTotal farming land in USA is 900.21 million acres as of 2022.\nTotal farm land in Florida is 9.73 million acres as of 2017.\nTotal farm land in California is 24.23 million acres as of 2017.\n (https://www.nass.usda.gov/AgCensus)\nRemaining 48 states have a farm land of 866.25 million acres.\nTotal farmland in Iowa is 30.56 million acres. (https://www.nass.usda.gov/AgCensus)\nConsidering tomatoes are grown uniformly in these farmlands, the proportion of farmland Iowa has compared to all 48 states (without California, Florida) is 3.52%.\nThe production of tomatoes in Iowa is (3.52% x 4206.4 tons) or, 148 tons.\nAs the production of tomatoes is distributed over 8 weeks (as mentioned in no 8), the weekly supply quantity of tomatoes is (148/8) or 18.5 tons or 16.78 Metric Tons.\nConsidering the average farm size in each county of Iowa is the same. The supply of tomatoes can be obtained from the number of farms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaser video: Video"

    "text": "Web Scraping: Automating Data Collection\nDue to the success of last year’s project, we were able to gather extensive data on products using web scrapers. This year, we were assigned a similar task but with different products. However, we encountered a significant challenge.\nOver the past year, the website we were scraping underwent significant changes, rendering our previous methods and processes obsolete. Upon closer examination, we discovered numerous unintentional flaws in our approach. Unfortunately, the scraper we had built was only capable of functioning under very specific circumstances, severely limiting our ability to collect data effectively even if we were able to repair it.\nTo ensure the success of our current project, it is crucial to gather a substantial amount of data. However, manually performing this task is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors and incredibly tedious. To overcome these challenges, we have developed web crawlers or spiders to automate the process. This automation not only saves time but also guarantees accurate and up-to-date data collection.\nIn simple terms, a Spider or Web crawler is a program or script specifically designed to automate website navigation and extract desired data. These spiders are not only capable of replicating our previous work but also surpassing the achievements of the previous year’s project by a considerable margin."

    "text": "Why a combined strategy is necessary?\nLet’s imagine a county acting as a single farmer. In order to maximize its profit, the farmer will aim to sell its product to the county that offers the highest price, while also taking transportation costs into account.\nIn this scenario, all the farmers (counties) will try to sell their tomatoes to a single county that offers the highest price.\nAs a result, there would be an influx of products, potentially leading to an oversupply where the demand may not match. Consequently, the price could decrease, while certain counties might face a shortage of tomatoes.\nTherefore, it becomes crucial for the farmers (counties) to adopt a collaborative strategy."

    "text": "Demonstration of the optimization model\nTo provide a demonstration, we select a small subset of counties (24 out of a total of 99 counties) where the gap between supply and demand is relatively modest.\nIn these selected counties, we simulate the prices of tomatoes using a normal distribution with a mean of 2.25 and a standard deviation of 0.25.\nFor our analysis, we took into account the Ford F-350 truck with a carrying capacity of 7640 lb and a fuel efficiency of 15 mpg. We assumed that the truck would travel in a straight line (Euclidean distance) from the origin to the destination. Additionally, we considered a gas price of $3.5/gallon."

(https://www.tomatofest.com/Tomato_Growing_Zone_Maps_s/164.htm)\nWe have 135 days between planting and harvesting tomatoes.\nTomatoes require 100 days to fully mature. However, there are some special varieties of tomatoes that require 50-60 days to mature. (https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/tomato/planting-time-for-tomatoes.htm)\nSo, we are considering on average tomatoes take 80 days to be harvested.\nIn this context, we assumed that being mature represents the time between sowing seed and harvesting full-grown tomatoes.\nWe are only considering single cultivation of tomatoes during a year.\nSo, the tomatoes will be harvested during the timeline day 80-135 or, during late July to mid-September, that is 7.85 or 8 weeks.\nIn our calculations, we will estimate the weekly supply of tomatoes from late July to mid-September.\nIn 2017, approximately 157 acres of tomatoes were harvested in the open field. (https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/)\nIn 2018, the yield for tomatoes in Iowa was 246 CWT per acre.
