    "text": "Since I needed to extract a large amount of data from the American Community Survey (ASC) and convert it into a CSV file. In light of this I wrote this code to extract ASC data from the table codes. The Code takes in a list of names that you want the file name to be. Along with the corresponding table code. It also takes in a folder name. It then makes (if needed) and adds the CVS files to the specified folder (For a clean directory). Its important to note that where you run the R file is where a folder is made. I made this with the intentions of it being editable (and hopefully user friendly).\n\n####################\n#  Inserting Data  #\n####################\n\n\nfolder <- \"Folder_Name_Here\" # <---------- Change this value FIRST!\n\nACSList <- c(\n    # \"Data Name\",\"DataCode\", \n    # ...\n  ) \nACSListToCSV(ACSList,folder)\n\n\n##########################################\n#  Global Variables That can be Changed  #\n##########################################\n\n#To change the get_acs() geography variable\ngeographyType <- \"county\"\n\n#To change the get_acs() servay variable\nservayType <- \"ACS5\"\n\n#Change to NULL if no state\nstateType <- \"IA\"\n\n#This will make a geometry file as well if TRUE\nwithGeometry <- FALSE\n\n#checking the year\nyear = NULL\n\n###################################\n#  Functions that make life easy  #\n###################################\n\n#Imports \nlibrary(tidycensus) #For ACS extractions\nlibrary(stringi) #For folderNameFixer()\nlibrary(tigris)\noptions(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)\n\n\n#File name changers.
