In light of this I wrote this code to extract ASC data from the table codes. The Code takes in a list of names that you want the file name to be. Along with the corresponding table code. It also takes in a folder name. It then makes (if needed) and adds the CVS files to the specified folder (For a clean directory). Its important to note that where you run the R file is where a folder is made.
