During week five I attended the ITAG VI conference. However the majority of the week was dedicated to building and optimizing spiders. At the end of the week I finished building four more spiders making seven spider built for the project. There are still many small improvements that need to be made. I also started to work on implementing a cleaning program that will clean the data while the spider runs.

Here is a link to what I've learn about building spiders: [Spider](https://cyberspeedac.github.io/Aaron-Case-DSPG-Blog/posts/Aaron_C_MultiWeek/Aaron_C_Spiders.html)

Here is a link to the code of all the modified and added spiders that was made during the week: [Week 5 Spider Code]()
