## **Optimization of the crop flow, from the point of supply to the point of demand that maximizes overall profit**

![](images/Figure_1.png){fig-align="center"}

1.  The red points represent the counties.

2.  The green lines represent the flow of crops, and the blue arrow shows the direction of the flow.

3.  Maximizes the revenue by selling the crops.

4.  Minimizes the cost of distance traveled.

5.  Relaxed previous assumption "Supply is greater than demand"

The following might be included in the project:

1.  A separate account of fresh and not fresh products.

2.  Consideration of each individual farmer's profit.

3.  Consideration of the flow of trucks rather than the flow of crops.

## **Demand and supply estimation**

**Disclaimer:** Supply and demand estimation requires further correction, and the methodology needs improvements.

### **Demand Estimation:**

1.  The population of United States is 334.9 million as of June 26, 2023. (<https://www.census.gov/popclock/>)

2.  In 2017, fresh market consumption was 20.3 pounds per capita. (<https://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/vegetables/tomatoes>)

3.  So, the demand for fresh tomatoes in the United States is (334.9 million x 20.3 pounds) or 3.08 Million Metric Tons.

4.  There is around 1% of the US population lives in Iowa.

5.  That translates to 30.8 thousand Metric Tons of tomatoes demand in Iowa.

6.  Considering the demand for tomatoes stays the same for 52 weeks. The demand for tomatoes in Iowa per week is 592 Metric Tons.

7.  We will allocate this demand to each county of Iowa by population.

### **Supply Estimation:**

1.  The growing season of tomatoes is between May to Mid-September in Iowa. (<https://www.tomatofest.com/Tomato_Growing_Zone_Maps_s/164.htm>)

2.  We have 135 days between planting and harvesting tomatoes.

3.  Tomatoes require 100 days to fully mature. However, there are some special varieties of tomatoes that require 50-60 days to mature.  (<https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/tomato/planting-time-for-tomatoes.htm>)

4.  So, we are considering on average tomatoes take 80 days to be harvested.

5.  In this context, we assumed that being mature represents the time between sowing seed and harvesting full-grown tomatoes.

6.  We are only considering single cultivation of tomatoes during a year.

7.  So, the tomatoes will be harvested during the timeline day 80-135 or, during late July to mid-September, that is 7.85 or 8 weeks. 

8.  In our calculations, we will estimate the weekly supply of tomatoes from late July to mid-September.

9.  In 2020, approximately 12,619.2 tons of fresh market tomatoes were harvested from approximately 272,900 acres. (<https://www.agmrc.org/commodities-products/vegetables/tomatoes>)

10. Florida and California account for about two-thirds of the national fresh tomato production (Wu, F., Guan, Z., & Suh, D. H. (2017). The Effects of Tomato Suspension Agreements on Market Price Dynamics.; mentioned in <https://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/publication/FE1027>)

11. The remaining 48 states are responsible for one-third of the national fresh tomatoes. That is 4206.4 tons.

12. Total farming land in USA is 900.21 million acres as of 2022.\
    Total farm land in Florida is 9.73 million acres as of 2017.\
    Total farm land in California is 24.23 million acres as of 2017.\
     (<https://www.nass.usda.gov/AgCensus>)

13. Remaining 48 states have a farm land of 866.25 million acres.

14. Total farmland in Iowa is 30.56 million acres. (<https://www.nass.usda.gov/AgCensus>)

15. Considering tomatoes are grown uniformly in these farmlands, the proportion of farmland Iowa has compared to all 48 states (without California, Florida) is 3.52%.

16. The production of tomatoes in Iowa is (3.52% x 4206.4 tons) or, 148 tons.

17. As the production of tomatoes is distributed over 8 weeks (as mentioned in no 8), the weekly supply quantity of tomatoes is (148/8) or 18.5 tons or 16.78 Metric Tons.

18. Considering the average farm size in each county of Iowa is the same. The supply of tomatoes can be obtained from the number of farms.
