During the first week, I had the chance to provide a brief introduction of myself to the client. This involved taking the necessary time to clearly communicate my role in the project, thereby establishing a professional connection with the Employer.

After concluding the introduction, we proceeded with the debriefing process of the project with the Employer. We discussed the project's background, with a specific focus on the progress made during the first year. Additionally, we received a comprehensive overview of the previous work that had been completed. Once we were caught up with this overview, we dived into the project's scope, addressing the specific tasks and goals that needed to be accomplished. This in-depth discussion provided us with a better understanding of the project and clarified what needed to be done.

Regarding the goals for week one, my primary objective was to acquire as much knowledge and experience about Python and R in Datacamp.

Lessons completed:

-   Introduction to R
-   Intermediate R
-   Cleaning Data in R
-   Introduction to Python
