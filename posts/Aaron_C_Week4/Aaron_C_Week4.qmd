During week four, my main focus was on learning and building spiders. I dedicated a significant amount of time to this task and successfully completed the construction of three separate spiders. Nevertheless, It is important to note that while the spiders are functional, there is still room for further improvements, as the code is not yet fully refined. Additionally, During week four I participated in the collection of housing data in Slater Iowa for the WINVEST project. While this activity was aimed for preparation for whats to come in [Week Six]() it did not detract from the primary focus on learning and building spiders during week four.

For a detailed explanation of my endeavors and what I have learned, you can visit this link: [Spiders](https://cyberspeedac.github.io/Aaron-Case-DSPG-Blog/posts/Aaron_C_MultiWeek/Aaron_C_Spiders.html). This link will direct you to an overview of my progress, including updates on what I have learned during the week. Please note that I will be updating this link to include my knowledge from [Week Five](https://cyberspeedac.github.io/Aaron-Case-DSPG-Blog/posts/Aaron_C_Week5/Aaron_C_Week5.html) as well.

For those who are interested, I have included some of the outputs generated by the spider below. These outputs serve as examples of the spider's functionality and demonstrate the successful results achieved during the learning and building process in week four.
